title: Buy a Glowforge
---

I made this project using my [Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/). Glowforge is a
high-quality, very easy-to-use laser cutter. I love my Glowforge Basic and I
use it to cut and engrave wood, cardboard, and acrylic for my projects.

If you want your own, why not use [my Glowforge referral
link](https://glowforge.us/r/1MR4or)? You’ll get a discount and I’ll get a
kickback. Win-win.
